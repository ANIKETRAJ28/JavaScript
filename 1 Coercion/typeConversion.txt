Every language has got some mechanism for type interconversion.
Eg. In Java we can do Systum.out.println("Hello"+22)
-- the above statement prints Hello22 i.e it converted 22 to string -> "22" and concatinated them as Hello22

Types of interconversion
-> Implicit -- when language automatically converts type
-> Explicit -- when we manually command to convert type

Similarly in JS this concept exists.
For JS things are a bit tricky as JS handles wide variety of cases.

Abstract Operations -- These are operations/ functions which are not available for end users to use.
But JS internally uses it & these are mentioned in the official docs to actually aid the documentation
https://262.ecma-international.org/10.0/#sec-abstract-operations -- docs link

Abstract Types
-> ToPrimitive
-> ToNumber
-> ToString
-> ToBoolean
etc.

We directly cannot call them but some operations like '-' subtraction, '+' addition etc internally calls them and hence we can mimic them using these operations
